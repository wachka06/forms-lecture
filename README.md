## Imperative vs Declarative Programming
* Imperative Programing Paradigm has an emphasis on how you do something where as Declarative Programming Paradigm has an emphasis on what you’re trying to do.

Example: You go to a restaurant with a friend and approach the front desk:
The imperative approach would be: _"I see that there are is an empty table for two in that table over there. My friend and I are going to walk over there and sit down."_
The declarative approach would be: _“Table for two please."_

Example: You’re driving a car and you’re trying to go from 0 to 60.
Imperative would be like driving manual shift because you as the driver have to keep track of what gears you need to go to be able to go from 0 to 60.
Declarative approach would be like driving automatic, you just step on the gas peddle and the car takes care of the rest.

* How does this help me be a better React Programmer?
- You can talk about your design decisions when choosing technology.
- Go through light switch example.
- How might we have done this in Vanilla.js ?

* Key takeaway: When building user interfaces using React, think about WHAT you want your app to look like/do at any given state (if more than one). This will help you make informed decisions in terms of component structure.
